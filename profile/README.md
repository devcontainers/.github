## Welcome to the Development Containers Community

In this community we maintain the [Development Containers (dev container) Specification](https://containers.dev). The dev container spec defines a standard for any development tool to use a container as a full-featured development environment. Join us to continue to make this spec and the reference CLI implementation even better by joining the [discussion](https://github.com/orgs/devcontainers/discussions) or opening issues on the relevant repository.

The dev containers specification is maintained in the [spec repo](https://github.com/devcontainers/spec). 

We maintain a set of [images](https://github.com/devcontainers/images) and [Features](https://github.com/devcontainers/features) as part of the specification.

You can also [create and share your own Features](https://containers.dev/implementors/create-feature/). We've created a [Features template repo](https://github.com/devcontainers/feature-template) to help along the way.

The https://containers.dev site is in the [devcontainers.github.io repo](https://github.com/devcontainers/devcontainers.github.io).
