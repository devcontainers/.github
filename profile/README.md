## Welcome to the Development Containers Community

In this community we maintain the [Development Containers (dev container) Specification](https://containers.dev). The dev container spec defines a standard for any development tool to use a container as a full-featured development environment. 

Join us to continue to make this spec and the reference CLI implementation even better! There are several ways you can chat with the spec maintainers and the community:
* Open a GitHub [Discussion](https://github.com/orgs/devcontainers/discussions)
* Open issues on the relevant repository in the `devcontainers` org
* Join our Slack channel! You may reply to [this Discussion](https://github.com/devcontainers/community/discussions/3) to get added

The dev containers specification is maintained in the [spec repo](https://github.com/devcontainers/spec). 

We maintain a set of [images](https://github.com/devcontainers/images) and [Features](https://github.com/devcontainers/features) as part of the specification.

You can also [create and share your own Features](https://containers.dev/implementors/create-feature/). We've created a [Features template repo](https://github.com/devcontainers/feature-template) to help along the way.

The https://containers.dev site is in the [devcontainers.github.io repo](https://github.com/devcontainers/devcontainers.github.io).
